# WebsiteChecker
A put together python script that sends an HTTP request to asurascans.com for some of my webtoons

This project is finished, there's nothing to be done with it. Turns out you could just join the asurascans discord and get pinged lmfao, so this fell out of use pretty quickly.
Was fun while it lasted tho! Could optimize this a *tad* bit more but honestly nothing too pressing.
